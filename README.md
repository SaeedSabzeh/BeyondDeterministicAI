Beyond Deterministic AI: A Probabilistic Multi-Path Model for Subconscious-Like Thinking
BeyondDeterministicAI
A Probabilistic Multi-Path Model for Subconscious-Like Thinking

BeyondDeterministicAI is an advanced AI framework that moves beyond traditional deterministic processing by introducing probabilistic multi-path exploration, simulating subconscious-like thought patterns. Inspired by human cognitive biases and intuition, this model enables AI to retain and weigh lower-probability thought paths instead of discarding them entirely.

Key Features
🔄 Multi-Path Thought Exploration – AI follows multiple probabilistic reasoning paths in parallel.
🧠 Subconscious-Like Decision Making – Inspired by dual-process theory from psychology.
⚡ Intuitive & Contextual Awareness – Retains weak signals for future insights.
🔍 Bias and Memory Simulation – Models cognitive inertia and anchoring bias.
📊 Applicable in Generative AI, Cognitive Science, and Adaptive AI Models.
